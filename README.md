# Code Named
Code Named is a simple placeholder project name generator I made because I didn't feel like using anyone elses code.

Code Named generates project names by combining `n` adjectives and a noun. The amount of adjectives as well as the amount of names generated can be configured via commandline arguments (see `code_named --help`). Currently the default noun list only includes animals, but you can pass your own noun and/or adjective list on the commandline, if you would like to do so.
